# Proof of Majority Protocol

Tabbre's proof of majority protocol (POMP) delivers a true peer to peer payment system. 

Tabbre POMP is an account based system. Value is held in accounts that are maintained by wallet programs. Account owners are responsible for storing the transaction history and related metadata for their accounts.
Tabbre POMP is a peer to peer transactional system, transactions are sent as messages from one wallet to another. Tabbre Witness nodes are used by the wallets to approve and validate transactions.
The Tabbre POMP Witness nodes store only enough account information to perform this role.
Nodes hold just enough information about an account to validate transactions.

The Tabbre POMP Consensus is based on a voting system where a majority of participating witness nodes are required to agree that a transaction is valid.
